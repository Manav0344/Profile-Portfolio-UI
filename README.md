Profile Portfolio
This is my personal profile portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional information in a clean and modern layout. The portfolio includes sections for:

About Me – A brief introduction highlighting my background, skills, and interests.

Projects/Portfolio – Showcases my completed projects with visual cards and descriptions.

Contact – A contact form for inquiries, collaborations, or messages.

Navigation & Responsiveness – Smooth navigation menu and a responsive design that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.



The design emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and usability. All elements are structured for easy updates, making it a great template for personal branding. This project demonstrates front-end development skills including semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques, responsive design with media queries, and basic interactivity.

It’s ideal for anyone looking to create a professional online presence or as a foundation to expand into more advanced front-end projects.
